# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to rework CSS so it looks better on phones.
I would like to add the ability to pre-order drinks 
I would like to add a feedback section in the footer that lead to a form with rating scale and text area
I would like to add more animations so as a person scrolled down, the images or embedded content appeared rather than being static
